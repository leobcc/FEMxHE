# FEniCS Examples

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of code to solve heat diffusion problems using the FEniCS project. We focus specifically on examples regarding heat diffusion problems. These examples are officially provided by the FEniCS project team. A more detailed and thorough explanation of how to use the FEniCS library can be found at https://jsdokken.com/dolfinx-tutorial/.

The notebooks provide examples of how to use FEniCS to solve various heat diffusion problems. Each notebook includes a detailed explanation of the problem being solved, the mathematical model used, and the implementation of the code to solve the problem.

To run the notebooks, you will need to have FEniCS installed in your environment. In order to do so, we suggest you follow the instructions to use the docker image for dolfinx with jupyter environment, which you can find on the main page. (this method should work regardless of your OS) For more information on FEniCS, please visit the project website at https://fenicsproject.org/.
